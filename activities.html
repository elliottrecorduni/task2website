			<h2>Doubles in Badminton</h2>
			<p>This is where there will be two members of a team on each side of the court, this is similar to singles, where there can be two men against two men, or two women against two women and finally mixed doubles which is one man and one woman against one man and one woman, this game is far more aggressive in comparison to singles in which an all out attack method is used with extremely fast rallies and powerful shots!</p>
