			<p>On the 9th of October, our team had a short travel to Southampton University in which they were to
			play their second game. The day started off slow with two close losses, however everyone pulled
			together after a huge team speech from Dan; from this all remaining games were won! Elliot played
			first after the slow start and secured vital points to start the win streak. Shobë was up next, he
			played a solid game throughout and smashed his opponent with no mercy, the atmosphere was
			rising and with these two wins on our side our confidence as a team grew. Connor then played a
			game and also dominated his opponent, the team was looking unstoppable! Dan was the final
			member of the men&#39;s team to play, and his opponent was a renowned player, after a shaky start Dan
			managed to pull the game back to give us even more momentum heading into the girls tournament! <br><br>
			Ellie started the girls team off to a very impressive game, both girls from both teams were
			determined not to lose and this showed in the length of the game, however the will power of Ellie
			came through and the game was won in great style! The rest of the girls team all won their
			remaining matches securing the team the second win of the season with an impressive score of <b>8-2.</b><br><br>
			The team was showing signs of great things to come, and the relationship between them was strong
			enough to encourage one another to go out and get the win!<br><br>
			Players: Steve, Matt, Elliot, Shobë, Connor, Dan, Ellie, Shannon, Lauren &amp; Millie.<br><br>
			Notable Performances: <b>Shobë &amp; Ellie</b>

			<p>On the 3rd of September the team played their first game against Portsmouth university and they won 5-3. This was a great win for the team as it was their first tournament against any teams. Elliot played a crucial role in leading the team in victory. Elliot played two singles match and theses were played at the end of the day and there were the last two games which had to be won in order to secure victory for Bournemouth University. Elliot had a tough match but he managed to pull through it even after losing his first set on his singles match. His victory meant that the team was able to win over all.
			<br><br>
			The girls team played very well and contributed to the team win overall. They won 2 of their 4 matches and Ellie contributed the most in leading the team to victory as she was able to win her singles match and also contributed to the win in their doubles match. Overall it was a good day for the team as they were able to win their first match against a professional team.</p>
